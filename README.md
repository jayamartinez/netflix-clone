## Lessons Learned

Gained a deeper understanding of React, especially in terms routing with React Router. First time working with MongoDB and Express, which introduced me to handling data and creating server-side logic to interact with my React app. Learning how to set up APIs broadened my view on how the backend connects with the frontend.

Using [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)  and axios helped me learn how to integrate third-party APIs better. Taught me more about error handling and optimizing API calls for a better user experience.
